# EconometrcisMLProject
In this project I analyzed and visualized population of various countries to draw conclusions about dependencies of the factors on Population and tried to presume what can have the strongest/weakest impact. Same way, tried to find out some pecularities.
It was a combination of Econometrics and Machine Learning.
